Problem 1: Day Calculation and Calendar Printing
This program takes a user input of a specific date (day, month, and year) and calculates the corresponding day of the week. It also prints the calendar for the respective month and year.
Problem 2: 15-Puzzle Game
The user must slide numbered tiles to arrange them in order (1â€“15), with the blank tile represented by 0. The puzzle is shuffled initially, and the player can make moves by selecting a tile adjacent to the blank tile.
Problem 3: Minesweeper Game
The Minesweeper game starts with hidden mines placed randomly on the grid. The program takes input for the row and column numbers. If the selected cell contains a mine, the game ends. If the cell contains a number, it displays the count of adjacent mines, and the player must provide additional input to continue.
